Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends
## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of the report is to find the best month that would provide a successful launch and find the most optimal funding goal that would increase the chances of success for Louise’s play “Fever” 

## Analysis
### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the graph, we can see that May to July are the best months to launch the play, as they have the biggest difference between successful and failed plays as the lines are at their furthest during this point. So, we can assume that a play is most likely to succeed if the launch date is during any of these months. We can also conclude that October to December are the worst months to release a play as the difference between successful to failed plays is lower since the lines are closer together during these months.

### Outcome-Based on Goal

Based on the results the graph demonstrates a general trend where the higher the goal it will have a greater chance of failing than succeeding. Also, it appears there may be some outliers in the data in the range of $35000 - $44999. The reason since the lines show that the higher the goal the more likely the play will fail and then at $35000 - $44999 the Percentage of successful plays greatly improves and the percentage of failed plays drops.

### Challenges
I had not encountered any challenges for this report, but one challenge that someone could have is the formulas to get the total number of successful, failed, and canceled plays for each range. As you would need to work with multiple conditions, being start and end numbers for the range. So, if someone doesn’t know about the AND or OR functions in Excel their formula could end up being long and hard to follow and could probably give errors.

## Results
### Results of Outcomes-based on Launch Date
From the graph, we can see that May would be the best month to launch the play as it has the highest number of successful plays compared to the other months, and it has the best rate of successful to failed plays. We can also conclude that December would be the worst date to launch a play as there is almost the same number of successful plays as failed plays. 
### Results Outcome-Based on Goals
The funding goal that Louise should aim for is anything between the range of $1000 or less as this offers the highest chance of success and has the lowest odds of failing to all of the other ranges as well. Thus, it would be optimal for Louise to have a goal of $1000 or less for the best possibility of success.
### Limitations
The issue with just using the two graphs is that they don’t show the quartiles, so we don’t know the range that most of the data is in, and the upper and lower limits. Also, we won’t know which of our data are outliers and skewing the data. As a result, a box and whiskers graph also should have been
